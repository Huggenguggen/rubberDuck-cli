# rubberDuck-cli
Fun side project written to learn golang


## GOAL
To make a simple terminal application which makes rubber duck(s) appear on the terminal. 

Ideally the user would be able to interact with them in some way and that there could be multiple rubber ducks

## Idea
> Ever want to rubber duck program but don't have a physical one right next to you? 
> Now you can make a digital companion to help you through tough time :)
